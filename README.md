# Hangman Game

This is a classic Hangman game implemented in Python. The player has to guess the letters in a randomly chosen word within a limited number of attempts. I created this game after practicing seven days of the Dr. Angela Yu Python course.This little game inside has a lot of contents, including FOR and WHILE LOOPS, IF/ELSE, RANGE, STRINGS, and the most important LISTS.Â
